# Big Ideas
Really just a listing of ongoing and proposed projects

| Project       |Description         | Collaborators | Status|
|:-------------:|-------------| -----| -----|
| Functional responses in invertebrate predators of vertibrates       |Examine factors affecting predator functional response in a co-evolved tropical aphibian-calliphorid fly system      | Nancy Karraker, University of RI| Brainstorming underway for grant submission to NSF DEB in late 2018|
|Ecotourism as an engine for ecological discovery    | Can we use ecosystem observations collected by ecotourist citizen scientists to generate data and hypotheses about critical ecosystems? | Stephanie Smith-Unna, Fathom Beyond |Seeking appropriate funding sources, student champion |
|Aphid suction trap network     | A surveilance network for aphids of the midwestern USA | Doris Lagos-Kutz, USDA-ARS and University of Illinois at U-C | Grant submitted to NSF-MSB-ECR, pending decision ~04/18|
|[Sapsuckrz](https://github.com/ReproducibleQM/sapsuckRz)     | An examination of environmental and landscape drivers of abundance of common aphid species| RQM students! |Analysis and writeup underway, Hackathon Dec 9 2017|
|Biodiversity in Cuyhoga Valley NP     | Observing above-ground processes in restored mine sites| Chris Blackwood, Anne Jefferson, Kent State University | Planning and early data collection stage |
|Microclimate and scale      | Following BioSCAN:  what scale of measurement matters in understanding microclimate drivers of biodiversity? | Terry McGlynn, Cal State Dominguez Hills |Awaiting a champion |
|BioSCAN     | An examination of biodiversity in Los Angeles backyards | Terry McGlynn, Cal State Dominguez Hills | [Data munging](https://github.com/cbahlai/microclimate_data_processing) and analysis ongoing |
|[Penguegg](https://github.com/ReproducibleQM/penguegg)     | What are the environmental drivers on Northern Rockhoper Penguin egg size? | Alex Bond, Royal Society for the Preservation of Birds | Currently with Alex, doing some necromancy|
|[Timberdoodle](https://github.com/zipkinlab/timberdoodle)   | An integrated population model for American Woodcock| The Zipkin Lab, led by Sarah Saunders, Michigan State University |In active development, writup underway Fall 2017|
|Phenology, climate change and invasions     | Will climate change exacerbate the impacts of invaders on communities of functionally similar native species? | Doug Landis, Michigan State University | Awaiting a champion- need to recruit a student |
|[The Bad Breakup Project](https://github.com/cbahlai/bad_breakup)    |Our conclusions often depend on when we sample a system. And how long we watch a system. this project aims to find out how we can optimize time series analyses for more robust conclusions across ecological domains. | Ilya Gelfand, Ben Gurion University | Algorithm developed, awaiting data and a champion|
|[The Monarch Regime project](https://github.com/cbahlai/monarch_regime)      | A new tool for detecting changes in dynamic rules in population time series data | Elise Zipkin, Michigan State University | Simulations completed, final preparation of manuscript underway|
