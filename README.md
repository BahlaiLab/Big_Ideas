# Big Ideas
Really just a listing of ongoing and proposed projects and ideas waiting to get off the ground. For current projects, see [this slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cPtDtlmiqhTWCKiX7vB9i_vlxV4c0NA5rE7Bt8OFZ_U/edit?usp=sharing)

| Project       |Description         | Collaborators | Status|
|:-------------:|-------------| -----| -----|
|Green roofs as novel ecosystems| Can we improve metrics for measuring ecosystem services in green roofs, to be applied to planning?| Reid Coffman, KSU Architecture| We got a seed grant from ESDRI at Kent State! Also, our grad student, Katie Manning, starts Fall 2018!|
|Coupled human natural systems- the case of grazing in rural communities in South Africa|Can we build a model to describe and predict the feedbacks between human decision making, environmental quality, and policy/resource manipulations in food insecure and poor rural communities? How Bayesian is it going to be? | David Ward, KSU and Lori Hunter, CSU| awaiting a champion|
| Functional responses in invertebrate predators of vertebrates       |Examine factors affecting predator functional response in a co-evolved tropical aphibian-calliphorid fly system      | Nancy Karraker, University of RI| Brainstorming underway for grant submission to NSF DEB in late 2018|
|Ecotourism as an engine for ecological discovery    | Can we use ecosystem observations collected by ecotourist citizen scientists to generate data and hypotheses about critical ecosystems? | Anyone and everywhere |Seeking appropriate funding sources, student champion |
|FoSTER! Biodiversity in Cuyhoga Valley NP     | Observing above-ground processes in restored mine sites| Chris Blackwood, Anne Jefferson, Kent State University | Seed money obtained! Student @cheyankpace started. Things are happening! |
|Microclimate and scale      | Following BioSCAN:  what scale of measurement matters in understanding microclimate drivers of biodiversity? | Terry McGlynn, Cal State Dominguez Hills |Awaiting a champion |
|BioSCAN     | An examination of biodiversity in Los Angeles backyards | Terry McGlynn, Cal State Dominguez Hills | In revision |
|Phenology, climate change and invasions     | Will climate change exacerbate the impacts of invaders on communities of functionally similar native species? | Doug Landis, Michigan State University | Awaiting a champion- need to recruit a student |
|[The Bad Breakup Project](https://github.com/cbahlai/bad_breakup)    |Our conclusions often depend on when we sample a system. And how long we watch a system. this project aims to find out how we can optimize time series analyses for more robust conclusions across ecological domains. | Kaitlin Stack Whitney, RIT | FUNDED BY NSF!|
|[The Monarch Regime project](https://github.com/cbahlai/monarch_regime)      | A new tool for detecting changes in dynamic rules in population time series data | Elise Zipkin, Michigan State University | Final manuscript submitted, in revision|
